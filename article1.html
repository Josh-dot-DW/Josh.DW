<p>
<h1>PAX Is Here!</h1>
<p>
So PAX or the Penny Arcade Expo is an annual exposition held in Seattle WA at the Washington Convention center. This gathering of gamers started out quite small, back in 2004 the folks at Penny Arcade wanted an event that catered to gamers, and just gamers, so they began the tradition. Now PAX has grown to host events on both coasts and even one in the middle of the US to help accommodate the gaming community. 
</p>
This is one of the only gaming events that the public can attend, most other events of this caliber are only for the gaming press and development teams. PAX bridges that gap for the rest of us out there that don’t have access to the inside world of journalism or development. 
<p>
I’ll have coverage for you of the Friday PAX events, concerts, panels, and Expo Floor over the weekend. Thanks everyone and keep checking back in.
