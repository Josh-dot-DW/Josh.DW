<h1>Microsoft Campus Open House</h1>
<p>
Later this evening I will be attending an open house along with a few other friends of mine at the Microsoft campus in Redmond Washington. This open house acts as a “kick off” party for PAX that opens tomorrow morning. This was pulled from the event page…

<blockquote>You’ll have access to play more than 50 upcoming ID@Xbox titles, including eight new announcements and several first playables! Meet the developers and play some of our most highly anticipated titles, including Cuphead, The Flame in the Flood, Pit People, ARK: Survival Evolved, We Happy Few, SpeedRunners, and Warhammer: Vermintide. Collect limited edition buttons for each game you play (while supplies last), and even pose for a picture with StudioMDHR’s Cuphead! See the Microsoft campus and stop by the Visitor Center to explore everything from the latest Microsoft Research innovations to the very first personal computer</blockquote>
