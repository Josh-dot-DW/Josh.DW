<h1>PAX Is Here!</h1>
<p>
So PAX or the Penny Arcade Expo is an annual exposition held in Seattle WA at the Washington Convention center. This gathering of gamers started out quite small, back in 2004 the folks at Penny Arcade wanted an event that catered to gamers, and just gamers, so they began the tradition. Now PAX has grown to host events on both coasts and even one in the middle of the US to help accommodate the gaming community. 
</p>
This is one of the only gaming events that the public can attend, most other events of this caliber are only for the gaming press and development teams. PAX bridges that gap for the rest of us out there that don’t have access to the inside world of journalism or development. 
<p>
I’ll have coverage for you of the Friday PAX events, concerts, panels, and Expo Floor over the weekend. Thanks everyone and keep checking back in.

<h1>Microsoft Campus Open House</h1>

Later this evening I will be attending an open house along with a few other friends of mine at the Microsoft campus in Redmond Washington. This open house acts as a “kick off” party for PAX that opens tomorrow morning. This was pulled from the event page…

<p>
<blockquote>You’ll have access to play more than 50 upcoming ID@Xbox titles, including eight new announcements and several first playables! Meet the developers and play some of our most highly anticipated titles, including Cuphead, The Flame in the Flood, Pit People, ARK: Survival Evolved, We Happy Few, SpeedRunners, and Warhammer: Vermintide. Collect limited edition buttons for each game you play (while supplies last), and even pose for a picture with StudioMDHR’s Cuphead!

Needless to say I’m very excited to have this opportunity and will have coverage for all you guys and gals over the weekend.
